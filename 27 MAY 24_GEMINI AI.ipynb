Mass can be converted into energy (like in nuclear reactions), and energy can be converted into mass (like in particle accelerators).\n> * **The Standard Model of Particle Physics:** This model describes the fundamental building blocks of the universe, including particles like quarks and leptons.  These particles have mass and interact through forces.\n> * **Dark Matter and Dark Energy:** A large portion of the universe's energy and mass is unknown. We call it \"dark\" because we can't directly observe it.  This means our understanding of the universe's composition is still incomplete.\n> \n> **So, is everything made of energy?**\n> \n> * **Technically, yes:** Because mass and energy are interconvertible, you could say that everything has an energy equivalent.\n> * **Practically, no:**  We experience the world as matter, not pure energy.  The particles that make up matter interact in specific ways to create the objects and phenomena we observe.\n> * **The answer is still evolving:**  As our understanding of physics and the universe deepens, we might find even more surprising connections between matter and energy. \n> \n> Ultimately, the question of whether everything is made of energy is a philosophical one. We can't definitively prove or disprove it with our current knowledge. \n"
